#Grid Computing

This software is for learning purpose. 
This software show how to develop "grid software" in java. In this example we have a first program that create a "space 
snapshot" (like a photo of the universe). These photo is made by a random number generator that draw the star (little
white pixel in black screen). These image will be divided and compute in different instances for decentralize/hyperthreadying
purpouse. 
The image, will be processed in little pieces for speedup the work. When the job is finished, every grid computing machine
send the work to the "server" that interpretate the final work.
